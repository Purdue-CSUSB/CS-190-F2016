CS Tools Course (CS 190)
========================

## Purpose

The Purdue CS 190 Tools course was started in Fall of 2013 by the
Undergraduate Student Board of Computer Science (USB) at Purdue.
The course was a response to the need of new CS students to learn
basic tools to be professional and efficient in their other CS
courses. The course focuses on practical skills required to be
a good programmer, starting with a functional knowledge of UNIX
shells, and ranging to editors, debuggers, and source control
software. Our goal is to give the students what they need early
in their careers and put them on a path to success in Computer
Science.

## Structure

The Tools course is taught for eight weeks at the beginning of 
the Fall semester for Freshman CS students. It consists of a one
hour lecture and a one hour lab each week. The labs for the course
can be found in the `labs/` directory, and the slides and demos
used in lecture can be found in the `slides/` and `demos/` 
directories respectively.

## Reference

We are also committed to providing resources for the students beyond
the classroom. Various tutorials and reference sheets applying to a
variety of useful topics can be found in the `tutorials/` and `reference/`
directories respectively. We are open to public contributions. If you
see a need for a tutorial or reference sheet not covered, please submit
a pull request with the new materials.
