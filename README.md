CS 190: Freshman Tools and Resources
====================================

## Purpose

The Purdue CS 190 Tools course was started in Fall of 2013 by the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board (USB) at Purdue. The course was a response to the need of new CS students to learn basic tools to be professional and efficient in their other CS courses. The course focuses on practical skills required to be a good programmer,s starting with a functional knowledge of UNIX
shells, and encompasses editors, debuggers, and source control software. Our goal is to give students what they need early in their careers and put them on a path to success in Computer Science.

## Structure

CS 190 is taught for sixteen weeks, alternating two sections weekly, at the beginning of the fall semester for Freshman CS students. It consists of a one hour lecture and a one hour lab each week. The labs for the course can be found in the `labs/` directory, and the slides and demos used in lecture can be found in the `slides/` and `demos/` directories respectively.

## Reference

We are also committed to providing resources for the students beyond
the classroom. Various tutorials and reference sheets applying to a
variety of useful topics can be found in the `tutorials/` and `reference/` directories respectively. We are open to public contributions. If you see a need for a tutorial or reference sheet not covered, please submit a pull request with the new materials.
