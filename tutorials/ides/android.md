## Installation
1.  Head over to https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and click the "Download Android Studio" button. 
2.  Check the box below the terms and conditions and click the button below that. The download should start automatically, and you'll be redirected to a page with installation instructions for the platform that you are on.

## Setup

1. Run Android Studio
2. You'll be given the option to import your settings from a previous version. If you've used a previous version and want to use your settings, feel free to do so. Otherwise, select "I do not have a previous version of Android Studio or I do not want to import my settings". Then press OK.
3. Select the location of the JDK on your computer. If you don't have the JDK, the setup wizard will provide you with a link where you can download it. Install the JDK and then press "Detect" and then "Next".
4. For the install type, select "Standard".
5. Accept the license agreements (you don't have to read them if you don't want to).
6. Click "Finish" and wait for the downloads to complete.
