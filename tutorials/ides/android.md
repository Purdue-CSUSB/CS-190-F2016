# Getting Started With Android Studio
Copyright 2015 Joseph Khawly

Android Studio is an IDE developed by Google. The beta version was released in June 2014, and the first stable version was released in December 2014. It has since replaced Eclipse as the primary IDE for Android development.

## Installation
1.  Head over to https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and click "Download Android Studio". 
2.  Check the box below the terms and conditions and click the button below that. The download should start automatically, and you'll be redirected to a page with installation instructions for the platform that you are on.

## Setup

1. Run Android Studio
2. You'll be given the option to import your settings from a previous version. If you've used a previous version and want to use your settings, feel free to do so. Otherwise, select "I do not have a previous version of Android Studio or I do not want to import my settings". Then press OK.
3. Select the location of the JDK on your computer. If you don't have it, the setup wizard will provide you with a download link. Install the JDK and then press "Detect" and then "Next".
4. For the install type, select "Standard".
5. Accept the license agreements (you don't have to read them if you don't want to).
6. Click "Finish" and wait for the downloads to complete.

## Customizing Your IDE



## Version Control and GitHub Integration
Android Studio also allows you to add version control to your projects and upload them to GitHub right in the IDE.
