# GitHub


## Why would I use this?

In CS, what matters most is what you make, so you want a place to store those things for friends and recruiters to see. GitHub does just that. It serves as a portfolio of your work. Just make sure to include your URL on your resume (or wear [this t-shirt](https://github.myshopify.com/products/github-username-shirt) at hackathons and company recruiting days). You can also find some great programs that you didn't even know you wanted, like [this](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck).

## Student developer pack

When you sign up for Github (or if you're already signed up), you can get access to the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which gives you 5 free private repositories and a load of other goodies for as long as you're a student.

## Your Profile
Let's take a look at what the profile page looks like:

![](profile.png)

1. **The sidebar** - This contains some basic info such as your name, email address, website, and location.
2. **Tabs** - The contributions tab is shown everytime some visits a profile, and it displays your popular repositories and a graph of your contributions. The repositories tab will show all of the repositories you've created and forked. The public activity tab shows a feed of all your recent commits, forks, etc. When someone follows you, this will show up in their news feed.
3. **Contribution graph** - A display of how many contributions you've made on each day of the year. It also show your total contributions and your longest streak of consecutive ones.

### Helpful Advice
- Try to use a professional looking photo of yourself as your avatar (unlike me).
- Definitely include your email and personal website. If you don't have a website, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can help you set one up.
- Don't worry about how many followers you have or how many stars your repos have.

##Creating a Repository
1. Click on the '+' button next to your username.
2. Give the repository a name and click "Create Repository".
3. copy the url and add the repo as a remote to an exising one on your computer.
4. Push your commits by typing:
 	```
 	git push -u origin master
 	```
