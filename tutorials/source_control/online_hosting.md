# Github


## Why would I use this?

Your Github profile is kind of like a portfolio of your work. It shows friends and recruiters what you're capable of making. Just make sure to include your URL on your resume (or wear [this t-shirt](https://github.myshopify.com/products/github-username-shirt) at hackathons and company recruiting days). You can also use Github to contribute to other open-source programs as well as discover some really cool stuff.

## Student developer pack

When you sign up for Github (or if you're already signed up), you can get access to the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which gives you 5 free private repositories and a load of other goodies for as long as you're a student. Just give them your university email address
