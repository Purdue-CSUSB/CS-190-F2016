# Github


## Why would I use this?

Your Github profile serves as a portfolio of your work. It shows friends and recruiters what you're capable of making. Just make sure to include your URL on your resume (or wear [this t-shirt](https://github.myshopify.com/products/github-username-shirt) at hackathons and company recruiting days). You can also find some great open source software and contribute to a project.

## Student developer pack

When you sign up for Github (or if you're already signed up), you can get access to the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which gives you 5 free private repositories and a load of other goodies for as long as you're a student.

## Your Profile
Now let's take a look at the profile page

1. **The sidebar** - This contains some basic info such as your name, email address, website, and location.
2. **Tabs** - The contributions tab is shown everytime some visits a profile, and it displays your popular repositories and a graph of your contributions. The repositories tab will show all of the repositories you've created and forked. The public activity tab.
3. **Contribution graph** - A display of how many contributions you've made on each day of the year. It also show your total contributions and your longest streak of consecutive ones.

### Helpful Advice
- Try to use a professional looking photo of yourself as your avatar (unlike me).
- Definitely include your email and personal website. If you don't have a website, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can help you set one up.
- Don't worry about how many followers you have or how many stars your repos have.
- Make sure your commits are descriptive and useful, otherwise they could wind up on [here](http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/).
